1
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:07,708
I was very busy that summer.

2
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:12,917
Perhaps due to the
frequent disasters last year,

3
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,333
Cursed Spirits surged like maggots.

4
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:49,292
Exorcising, absorbing.
I kept repeating these tasks.

5
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:55,500
Exorcising.

6
00:00:55,917 --> 00:00:56,750
Absorbing.

7
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,083
No one knows

8
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,542
the taste of Cursed Spirits.

9
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:07,625
It's like swallowing a cloth
that has wiped vomit.

10
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,542
Exorcising.

11
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:11,792
Absorbing.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,208
What I saw wasn't anything special,

13
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,000
just well-known abominations.

14
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:21,625
I understand this very well.

15
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:24,375
That's why I've chosen to
be a Jujutsu Sorcerer to help people.

16
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:27,958
Since that day,

17
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:29,917
I've been constantly convincing myself.

18
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:32,375
Since that day...

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,333
That place

20
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:39,292
was originally a mansion
of a company president

21
00:01:39,292 --> 00:01:42,042
who ran a local barbecue chain store.

22
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,375
But last July,

23
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,625
due to the mad cow disease,

24
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:52,125
the barbecue store
suffered a devastating blow.

25
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,750
The president was burdened by huge debts
and committed suicide with his family.

26
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,208
Since then, the mansion

27
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,833
has become a well-known haunted spot.

28
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,958
Local high school students,
college students from other towns,

29
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,333
and freelancers

30
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,042
all came here to test their courage

31
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,083
and then disappeared one after another.

32
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:13,542
Perhaps it's the word of mouth
that led to the expansion of victims.

33
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:18,958
After all, rumors about haunted
spots spread particularly fast.

34
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:25,417
Especially recently, the spread is
incredibly fast because of the internet.

35
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:30,083
As a result, the Jujutsu Sorcerers'
workload has also increased.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,250
In addition, there are

37
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,000
three elementary school students
who disappeared on their way home,

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,208
their family members, the police,

39
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,500
their colleagues,

40
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,417
and friends.

41
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:43,208
They might have gone to the mansion
to search for the missing people,

42
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,333
and ended up being victimized.

43
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,875
It seems we must solve it
as soon as possible.

44
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:52,792
Jujutsu Headquarters think so too.

45
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:55,958
WARNING, NO ENTRY, FREQUENT DISAPPEARANCES
That's why they asked me to investigate.

46
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,292
WARNING, NO ENTRY, FREQUENT DISAPPEARANCES
They even offered a considerable reward.

47
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:01,500
Did you extort them again?

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,042
Don't make it sound so bad.

49
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:06,083
We negotiated.

50
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:08,375
Here we are.

51
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,042
Let's go.

52
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:16,083
(Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2)

53
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:18,708
Emerge from the darkness,
blacker than darkness.

54
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:19,583
Purify...

55
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,417
No need to pull down the curtain.

56
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,875
I can't sense any cursed energy.

57
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:30,583
It's most likely inside the building.

58
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,167
Just pull down the curtain
when we need to do it outside.

59
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:36,958
MAKES SENSE

60
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,333
The door is open.

61
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:42,542
But there's something blocking it.

62
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,458
What are these?

63
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:52,792
Miss Mei,

64
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:54,917
there is indeed a curse.

65
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,542
And it's everywhere.

66
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,292
Let's hurry inside.

67
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:07,958
I don't need a flashlight,
but you do, right?

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,042
Thank you so much.

69
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:14,333
Alright.

70
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,875
How magnificent.

71
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,667
There's still electricity here.

72
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:37,625
Let's do a quick check
inside the building first.

73
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,375
I'll check this floor,

74
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,792
and you go upstairs.

75
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,542
Alone?

76
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:44,958
Is there a problem?

77
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:48,250
No, no problem.

78
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,500
Then I'll leave it to you.

79
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,042
Alright.

80
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,042
This is the last room.

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,542
You could be a scream queen.

82
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:36,833
Don't scare me like that!

83
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,042
You're scaring yourself.

84
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,625
Have you finished the first floor?

85
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:48,583
This is the first floor.

86
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,208
I came along the
corridor on the first floor.

87
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:56,583
But

88
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,208
I think I just entered

89
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,458
the last room.

90
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,917
Snack box.

91
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:08,250
Potato chip packaging.

92
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,167
Drink cans, backpacks, sportswear.

93
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,125
I've already seen these things
three times.

94
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:19,042
And I left this mark

95
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:21,750
on my way here.

96
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,292
It seems

97
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:28,167
we have been trapped here.

98
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,500
Really?

99
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:43,500
How long is this corridor?

100
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,917
We've been walking for almost 30 minutes.

101
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:48,833
About four kilometers.

102
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,000
This isn't an innate domain, right?

103
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:55,250
No.

104
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,958
That is a manifestation of mental scenery.

105
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:00,125
So what is it?

106
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:01,833
Barrier technique.

107
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,917
Correct.

108
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:07,208
The victims were
probably trapped here too,

109
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,083
and eventually killed
by the Cursed Spirit.

110
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,792
But judging by the Cursed Technique,

111
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:17,042
the Cursed Spirit itself
isn't that strong.

112
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,042
As long as we can escape this barrier...

113
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:25,333
Now the question is

114
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,167
how you would break through?

115
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,792
This corridor will loop infinitely.

116
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,542
At first

117
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,708
it felt like this.

118
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,292
You're bold to touch it with bare hands.

119
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,958
I imagined it as a structure
similar to a doughnut.

120
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:52,625
But we've passed your mark four times.

121
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,542
I calculated the intervals
with my steps, and they are

122
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:56,792
122 steps,

123
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:58,042
203 steps,

124
00:08:58,542 --> 00:08:59,250
157 steps,

125
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,625
and 270 steps.

126
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,000
So marks and the interval
between marks are random.

127
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,292
I see.

128
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:09,875
The range of the loop is not fixed.

129
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,125
So I think

130
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:14,583
it's probably something like this.

131
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:18,583
The barrier is actually pieced together.

132
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:22,250
So as long as we run at
full speed in the corridor,

133
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,375
this barrier will surely

134
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:28,792
collapse at some point.

135
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,417
Almost, 90 points.

136
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:35,542
What did I miss?

137
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:38,542
If we have to run,

138
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:41,417
we must run in opposite directions, right?

139
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,125
I got it.

140
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,292
If my assumption of
the structure is correct,

141
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:47,917
then two people moving at high
speed in different directions

142
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:51,375
is more likely to break the barrier.

143
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,375
Once there's a gap,
we might be able to escape.

144
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,417
100 points.

145
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,833
That's decided then.

146
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,542
If it works,

147
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:01,542
you have to recommend me for a promotion.

148
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,208
How much money do you have?

149
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:05,625
What?

150
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,500
Never mind, I'll consider it.

151
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,250
Okay.

152
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,583
So...

153
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,042
Ready.

154
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,417
Run!

155
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,750
It worked!

156
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,292
I came to save you,

listen carefully.

Don't swallow it!

170
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,458
I'll absorb it later.

171
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,917
JUJUTSU HIGH SCHOOL, SOPHOMORE, SUGURU GETO
Satoru, it's not good to pick on the weak.

172
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:55,000
Which idiot would pick on the strong?

173
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,542
It's you who are being provocative, Geto.

174
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:03,042
Senior Utahime!

175
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,208
Are you alright?

176
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:06,833
JUJUTSU HIGH SCHOOL, SOPHOMORE, SHOKO IEIRI
Shoko!

177
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,833
JUJUTSU HIGH SCHOOL, SOPHOMORE, SHOKO IEIRI
I was really worried about you.

178
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,583
JUJUTSU HIGH SCHOOL, SOPHOMORE, SHOKO IEIRI
I haven't heard from you for two whole days.

179
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,667
Shoko!

180
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:18,375
Shoko, don't become like them!

181
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,208
I won't.

182
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,750
LOUSY
I won't become that lousy.

183
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,542
The ground where Utahime
stepped on will collapse!

184
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,250
Shut up.

185
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,583
Two days.

186
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,500
So the Cursed Spirit's barrier
indeed has time distortion.

187
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,958
It is rare, but we can
occasionally see it.

188
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,458
It just feels strange to me
since Miss Mei was also here.

189
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,542
Seems like it.

190
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,125
What?

191
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:48,333
Nothing. In other words,
I've actually been working for two days.

192
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:52,833
I think I need to ask
for additional compensation.

193
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,958
You're gonna extort someone again.

194
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,958
Back to the topic, all of you.

195
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:58,333
Where is the curtain?

196
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:03,167
A GAS PIPE EXPLOSION DUE TO DISREPAIR
Next news.

197
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:06,208
A GAS PIPE EXPLOSION DUE TO DISREPAIR
An explosion occurred yesterday in Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Prefecture.

198
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:09,292
- The cause was a gas pipe in disrepair.
- One of you said you'd pull down the curtain,

199
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:12,708
- Now we're switching to our reporter on the scene.
- and then you left the assistant supervisor and ran away, right?

200
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,083
GRADE 1 JUJUTSU SORCERER, MASAMICHI YAGA
You forgot to pull down the curtain.

201
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,542
Who was it?

202
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,833
Mister, can we not find the culprit?

203
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:21,958
Looks like it's you.

204
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,750
GUIDANCE

205
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,792
But anyway,

206
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:28,625
is it really necessary
to pull down the curtain?

207
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,375
It shouldn't matter
if ordinary people see it.

208
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,875
They can't see Cursed
Spirits or Jujutsu anyway.

209
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,250
Of course it's necessary.

210
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,750
To suppress Cursed Spirits,

211
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,167
it's crucial to maintain
their peace of mind.

212
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:49,417
For this, we must do our
best to hide the threats

213
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:51,833
that are invisible to them.

214
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:54,792
- Not just that...
- I get it.

215
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:04,458
But it's exhausting to care for the weak.

216
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,333
Seriously.

217
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,167
The weak get to survive

218
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,375
is the way society should be organized.

219
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,417
Suppressing the strong
and supporting the weak.

220
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:15,667
Listen carefully, Satoru.

221
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:18,750
Jujutsu exists to protect non-sorcerers.

222
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:21,458
What a grand speech.

223
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,500
I hate grand speeches.

224
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:26,375
What?

225
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:30,042
Imposing reasons or
responsibilities on power.

226
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:32,458
Isn't that a behavior only the weak have?

227
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:46,458
Don't just stand there on your
high horse making your big talk.

228
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:49,875
Better scram.

229
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:53,375
Let's talk outside, Satoru.

230
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:55,708
Are you lonely?

231
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:56,958
Go out yourself.

232
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,750
How long are you gonna keep this farce?

233
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,500
Where did Shoko go?

234
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,917
No idea.

235
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:05,792
To the bathroom, I guess.

236
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:08,000
Never mind.

237
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,500
There is a mission for you two.

238
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,417
What's that look?

239
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,208
Nothing.

240
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,875
Frankly, I think this mission
is too demanding for you guys.

241
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,958
But Master Tengen named you two.

242
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:24,542
The mission has two parts.

243
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,250
Star Plasma Vessel,

244
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,375
the suitable vessel for Master Tengen.

245
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,833
You will guard the girl

246
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,125
and get rid of her.

247
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,167
To guard and get rid of that kid?

248
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,417
That's right.

249
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:40,250
Has he finally lost it?

250
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,500
It's spring after all.

251
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,333
And he's about to become the
next principal. He must be too happy.

252
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:46,167
Enough with the jokes.

253
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:47,750
It's my decision whether
to take it as a joke.

254
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,417
- Is Master Tengen's Cursed Technique about to be initialized?
- It's my decision whether to take it as a joke.

255
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,417
What does that mean?

256
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:57,667
What?

257
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,417
Although Master Tengen has the
Cursed Technique of Immortality,

258
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:02,958
he's not ageless.

259
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,667
Aging alone isn't a problem,

260
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:07,917
but when aging exceeds a certain level,

261
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:10,500
the Cursed Technique will try
to rebuild the body.

262
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,750
Evolution.

263
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,792
He will no longer be a human,
but a higher-level being.

264
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:19,167
Isn't that great?

265
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:20,875
Sounds cool.

266
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,542
According to Master Tengen,

267
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,500
once that stage is reached,

268
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,833
his will is about to cease to exist,

269
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,667
and he will no longer be Master Tengen.

270
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,583
TOKYO JUJUTSU HIGH SCHOOL
For all the Jujutsu high schools,

271
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,125
the barriers of the
Jujutsu realm's strongholds,

272
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,500
the barrier techniques of
numerous assistant supervisors,

273
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,208
they all rely on Master Tengen
to increase their strength.

274
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,250
Without his help,

275
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,250
we won't even be able to
carry out defense and missions.

276
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:48,417
In the worst case,

277
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:51,500
Master Tengen might even
become an enemy of humanity.

278
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:53,708
So, every 500 years,

279
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,458
he has to merge with
a Star Plasma Vessel,

280
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,542
that is a suitable human
for Master Tengen,

281
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:01,042
and rewrite the body's information.

282
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:03,000
As long as the body is rejuvenated,

283
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,458
the Cursed Technique's effect
will be restored

284
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,833
and there will be no evolution.

285
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,583
Understood.

286
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,208
It's okay to evolve into
a mechanical Tyrannosaurus,

287
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,625
but not into a zombie Tyrannosaurus.

288
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,250
So we have to start over
from a Koromon, right?

289
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,750
You can think of it that way.

290
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:24,292
But the location of that Star
Plasma Vessel girl was disclosed.

291
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:28,375
Now there are two groups of
people who want to kill the girl.

292
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,583
The Curse User Group Q. They want
Master Tengen to lose self-control,

293
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:35,583
so they can seek to subvert
the current Jujutsu realm.

294
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:40,167
The other one is the Star Religious Group
that worships Master Tengen,

295
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:42,792
Time Vessel Association.

296
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:48,292
Master Tengen and the Star Plasma Vessel
will merge under full moon in two days.

297
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:50,000
Before that day,
you must protect that girl

298
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,750
and bring her to Master Tengen.

299
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:57,083
If the mission fails,
it may even affect the general public.

300
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,458
You must be very careful.

301
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,083
Well.

302
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,875
I can understand the intention
of Curse User Group Q.

303
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,583
But why did the Star Religious
Group want to kill that girl?

304
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:11,417
Because they worship
the pure Master Tengen.

305
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:16,417
They don't allow the Star Plasma Vessel,
an impurity, to tarnish him.

306
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:20,167
The Star Religious Group
is a non-sorcerers group,

307
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:22,542
so we don't need to worry about them.

308
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:24,875
What we need to be most wary of is "Q".

309
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,208
There shouldn't be any problem.

310
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,000
We are the strongest after all.

311
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,875
That's why Master Tengen asked for us.

312
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:35,667
What's the matter?

313
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:37,500
Nothing.

314
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,792
Satoru, I wanted to remind you before.

315
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:43,375
You should stop using "I" as a pronoun.

316
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:49,042
Especially in front of
people of higher status.

317
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:51,458
We might meet Master Tengen later.

318
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,792
You should use "me."

319
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,042
Or at least use "younger".

320
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:56,917
So that people younger than you
won't be so afraid of you.

321
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,500
I don't want to.

322
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:03,083
I'm telling you, Satoru... Never mind.

323
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,333
We'll talk about it next time.

324
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,292
Coming.

325
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,000
Is she still alive?

326
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,208
I am still alive.

327
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,750
If that girl died now,
would they blame us?

328
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:26,458
AH
Ah.

329
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,750
Don't hate me.

330
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:41,083
Q COMBATANT KOKUN
Hate Master Tengen instead.

331
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,917
Please don't make a big fuss.

332
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,250
I just got scolded this morning.

333
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,833
This kid is the Star Plasma Vessel.

334
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,375
Judging by your uniform, you are a Jujutsu
sorcerer from the high school, right?

335
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,750
Hand over that girl,

336
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,333
or I'll kill you.

337
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:00,542
I can't hear you clearly.

338
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:02,292
Can you come closer?

339
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:05,083
I caught up...

340
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:10,917
Impressive.

341
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,167
You're Satoru Gojo, right?

342
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,875
Q COMBATANT BAYER
You're famous.

343
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,208
I heard you're very strong.

344
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,458
Let me confirm if the rumors are true.

345
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,917
Sure.

346
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:25,417
But let's decide on the rules first.

347
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:26,792
Rules?

348
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:29,833
I don't want to be
scolded for going too far.

349
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,125
As long as you cry and apologize,
I'll spare your life.

350
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,958
That's the rule.

351
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,667
You brat.

352
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:40,042
It's started.

353
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:45,083
The Star Religious Group has no power
to fight against jujutsu sorcerers.

354
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:48,333
But they're quite generous with money.
I can guarantee that.

355
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,542
What do you think, Zenin?

356
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:55,000
Will you join the assassination
of the Star Plasma Vessel.

357
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:59,417
I'm no longer a Zenin,
because I got married.

358
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,625
My last name is Fushiguro now.

359
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,042
Alright.

360
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:05,917
I accept the proposal.

361
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,917
(Episode 25: Hidden Inventory)

362
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,958
Sometimes there are some unfamiliar words
spinning around in my head for no reason.

363
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,667
Like Konden Einen Shizai Law?

364
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,708
Exactly, like Corporate Governance.

365
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,083

Shoko, give me another one.

368
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:52,458
(Next Episode: Hidden Inventory - 2 -)
Chagu Chagu Umakko.
